# Party Reward Actions:
#
# The party reward actions use the same format as regular actions however
# chance actions require a chance to be specified at the start of the string.
# Guaranteed actions will be executed at the start of the party no matter what
# wheras chance actions give players a chance to have the action executed.
#
# The actions that will always be executed for each player
# guaranteed_actions:
# - '[give-item] DIAMOND|64'
#
#
# The actions that players have a chance of being executed for them.

# - '[chance=50][give-item] EMERALD|64'

# Placeholders:
# There are a bunch of placeholders built into the plugin that can be used in messages or
# item names, lore etc. These can all be found on the plugin page.
