# This is the forwarder file where you will specify whether or not you want
# votes received to be sent to other servers. This is useful if you are
# attempting to reward players on multiple servers in a multi-server setup.
# Any votes received will be sent to every server specified below.

#
# Settings:
#
# Whether or not you want to forward votes received on this server
# use_forwarder: true
#
# Whether or not you want to log forwarded votes in the console
# use_logger: true
#

#   server_1: ##A unique identifier for the forwarder
#     ip: 127.0.0.1 ##The ip address of the server to send the vote to
#     port: 8807 ##The votifier port of the server you are sending the vote to
#     votifier_key: <key> ##The votifier public key of the server you are sending the vote to
